### Diameter Measurements from Two Caliper Types

The diameter of a ball bearing was measured by 12 inspectors, each using two different kinds of calipers. The results were

| Instructor | Caliper1 | Caliper 2 |
|------------|----------|-----------|
| 1          | 0.265    | 0.264     |
| 2          | 0.265    | 0.265     |
| 3          | 0.266    | 0.264     |
| 4          | 0.267    | 0.266     |
| 5          | 0.267    | 0.267     |
| 6          | 0.265    | 0.268     |
| 7          | 0.267    | 0.264     |
| 8          | 0.267    | 0.265     |
| 9          | 0.265    | 0.265     |
| 10         | 0.268    | 0.267     |
| 11         | 0.268    | 0.268     |
| 12         | 0.265    | 0.269     |

-   Is there a significant difference between the means of the population of measurements from which the two samples were selected? Use $\alpha=0.05$.

-   Find the $p$-value for the test.

-   Construct a 95 percent confidence interval on the difference in mean diameter measurements for the two types of calipers.

### R Code

```{r, include=TRUE, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE, results='hide', fig.show = 'hide'}
# Data
Caliper1 <- c(0.265, 0.265, 0.266, 0.267, 0.267, 0.265, 0.267, 0.267, 0.265, 0.2638, 0.268, 0.265)
Caliper2 <- c(0.264, 0.265, 0.264, 0.266, 0.267, 0.268, 0.264, 0.265, 0.265, 0.267, 0.268, 0.269)

# Normality Test
Differences <- Caliper1 - Caliper2
boxplot(Differences,
        main = "Distribution of Differences Between Caliper1 and Caliper2",
        ylab = "Difference in Diameter Measurements (units)",
        col = "lightblue")
shapiro.test(Differences)

# Test for Equality of Mean
t.test(Caliper1, Caliper2, paired = TRUE) 
```

#### Normality Check

![](02DM.png){width="395"}

As seen from the boxplot of the differences in diameter measurements between Caliper 1 and Caliper 2, the distribution appears roughly symmetric. Although the median is slightly above the center, indicating a mild left skew, the deviation is minimal. These observations suggest that the normality assumption is reasonably met. To further validate these observations, we apply the Shapiro-Wilk test.

-   **Hypotheses**

    -   $H_0:$ The data follows a normal distribution.

    -   $H_a:$ The data does not follow a normal distribution.Â 

-   **Level of Significance:** $\alpha=0.05$

-   **Test Statistic**

    |            Data             | W statistic | $p$-value |
    |:---------------------------:|:-----------:|:---------:|
    | Differences in Measurements |   0.90163   |  0.1665   |

<!-- -->

-   **Decision Rule:** Reject $H_0$ if $p < \alpha=0.05$

    -   Since $p = 0.1665 > \alpha = 0.05$, we fail to reject $H_0$.

-   **Interpretation/Conclusion**

    -   At the 95% confidence level, there is sufficient statistical evidence to conclude that the data is normally distributed and is suitable for **Paired T-Test**.

#### (a) Test for Equality of Means

-   **Hypotheses**

    -   $H_0:$ There is no significant difference in the mean caliper diameter measurements.

    -   $H_a:$ There is a significant difference in the mean caliper diameter measurements.

-   **Level of Significance:** $\alpha=0.05$

-   **Test Statistic**

| t statistic | DF  | $p$-value |
|:-----------:|:---:|:---------:|
|  -0.15617   | 11  |  0.8787   |

-   **Decision Rule:** Reject $H_0$ if $p < \alpha=0.05$

    -   Since $p = 0.8787 > \alpha = 0.05$, we fail to reject $H_0$.

-   **Interpretation/Conclusion**

    -   At the 95% confidence level, there is sufficient statistical evidence to conclude that there is no significant difference in the mean caliper diameter measurements.

#### (b) $p$ - VALUE

-   From the Paired t-Test table above, we get a $p$-value of 0.8787.

#### (c) 95% Confidence Interval

-   A 95% confidence interval on the difference in mean diameter measurements for the two types of calipers is [-0.001509318, 0.001309318].
